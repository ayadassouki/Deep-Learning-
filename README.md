# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Project

## Overview
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address image classification tasks. By leveraging the power of TensorFlow and Numpy within a Jupyter notebook environment, this project demonstrates the model's training, evaluation, and application phases to classify images effectively.

## Features
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the CNN model.
- **Numpy**: Employed for high-performance numerical computation.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting training results and visualizing data.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Used for preprocessing and pipeline creation.
- **Docker**: Ensures a consistent environment for development and deployment, encapsulating the project and its dependencies in a container.

## Project Outcomes
- Development of a robust CNN model capable of classifying images with high accuracy.
- Deployment of a machine learning model within a Docker container, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
- Integration of various data science and machine learning tools to facilitate comprehensive analysis and visualization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your local machine. Installation guides for Docker can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository (optional):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
## Build the Docker Container
Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:
```bash
docker build -t cnn-image-classifier .
```
## Run the Container
Launch the Docker container with the following command:

```bash

docker run -p 8888:8888 cnn-image-classifier
```
This command runs the container and maps port 8888 of the container to port 8888 on your host, allowing you to access the Jupyter notebook by navigating to http://localhost:8888.
## Usage
After starting the Docker container, access the Jupyter notebook interface through your browser:

- **Open** http://127.0.0.1:8888 and enter the token provided in the terminal.
- **Navigate** to the cnn.ipynb notebook within the Jupyter interface to view the project. This notebook contains detailed instructions and code blocks that demonstrate the training and usage of the CNN model.
